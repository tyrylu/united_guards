0.3 - September 26 2012
I tried to rewrite the game so it becomes less messy for me and other guys who may be interested in my code. I am not sure if I succedded anyway.
I have added local score board and ability to browse it and reset it. I have to play with locale settings, because date of your score is not displayed in your local format.
Added czech translation and there is an .pot file in source package, so you can create your own translations and they SHOULD be included in the game automatically.
The game automatically selects appropriate voice for current language - only with speech dispatcher.

added title to the game window
